# Reactive Playground Project 

A simple Java project used for learning [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) core concepts. 
Project Reactor is a Java framework from VMware that implements the [Reactive Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/) specification. 
This initiative provides a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure for the JVM and JavaScript runtimes. 
It is the foundation of the reactive stack in the Spring ecosystem and WebFlux applications.
